Welcome to the Python RESTful API test
======================================


The objetive of this test if to help us evalute your skills with:

    Problem Solving
    Web Server API Design
    Request-time data manipulation
    Testing strategies
    Deployment

**Instructions**

    Fork the repo into a private repo.
    Create a virtualenv for this project and install requirements.txt file
    Modify the pr-api module to complete the require API endpoints
    Let us know when you have finished.

**Deliverable**

Publish your work in a GitHub repository. Please use Python 3.x for your coding. Feel free to modify this readme to give any additional information a reviewer might need.
If you need more than 2 - 3 hours to do this, you might be overthinking, feel free to add improvement notes in your README file, show-off there :)


**Notes**

* Feel free to use any approach to deliver us the code..hint: A big bonus if you give us a Dockerfile we can just boot up and see application working
* Indicate what testing approach are you using...TDD, write code and test later, mocking, and tell us how to test your code
* Using MongoDB is required to store and retrieve data
* Try to adhere to Python etiquette (idiomatic and PEP-8 compliant code)
